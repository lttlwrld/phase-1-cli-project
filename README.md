# phase-1-cli-project

Welcome to my final project for Phase 1 of the Flatiron School. This application will be a CLI that takes data from the NBA's API, and provide users stats about their favorite player. Players are searchable by name or by team, and the app will provide user with information such as draft pick, points per game, rebounds, assits, field goal percentage and much more!
